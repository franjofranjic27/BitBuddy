# BitBuddy - Your Crypto Trading Bot

This project is a **crypto trading Bot** built with **Spring Boot (Java 21)**.  
It follows a microservice architecture and is managed as a **monorepo**.  
Each service has its own database and responsibilities.

- Publishes data to Kafka (`market-data-topic`)

### 2. Trade Decision Service
- Consumes market data from Kafka
- Applies decision logic (strategies, thresholds, rules)
- Produces trading decisions (e.g., BUY/SELL signals)

### 3. Order Execution Service

- Sends executable orders to an exchange (simulated or real)
- Persists executed orders into its own Postgres DB
